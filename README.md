# TaskEase
TaskEase is a productivity application designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks. The app allows users to create tasks, organize them by priority, break them down into subtasks, and track progress. By integrating gamification elements such as points for task completion and daily challenges, TaskEase motivates users to stay on top of their goals. It also features reminders and notifications to ensure users donâ€™t miss important deadlines.

The application is built using React Native for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android) and leverages Firebase for real-time data storage and user authentication.
